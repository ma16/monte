RASPBIAN INSTALLATION

The following description may be helpful if you install Raspbian for the first time.

Note: You may want to invoke raspi-config instead of the instructions used here; in order to make these changes and for further setups. If your system is connected to the internet, you may want to consider additional security measures.

(*) Write Image to SD Card:

A (fresh) Raspbian image (2017-09-07) is used. The SD card, which will be used in the Raspberry Pi, is prepared beforehand on a Linux desktop. The wildcard '/dev/sdX' is used for the SD card's actual device name (e.g. /dev/sdc).

$ export DEV=/dev/sdX
$ wget https://downloads.raspberrypi.org/raspbian/images/raspbian-2017-09-08/2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch.zip
$ unzip -p 2017-09-07-raspbian-stretch.zip | sudo dd of=$DEV bs=1M status=progress
$ sudo partprobe $DEV

Notes:

* The write operation may take serveral minutes. For a class 10 SDHC card it took here about nine minutes.
* Older dd implementations may not support the option 'status=progress'.

(*) Enable a Headless Pi with SSH and WLAN:

If you want to run a headless Pi, you can prepare the SD card as follows before you boot it up for the first time.

Enable the SSH daemon:

$ sudo mkdir -p /media/pi
$ sudo mount ${DEV}1 /media/pi
$ sudo touch /media/pi/ssh
$ sudo umount /media/pi

Enable WLAN:

$ sudo mount ${DEV}2 /media/pi
$ echo '
network={
    ssid="APN" 
    psk="PASSWORD" 
}' | sudo tee -a /media/pi/etc/wpa_supplicant/wpa_supplicant.conf
$ sudo umount /media/pi
$ sudo rmdir /media/pi

...APN and PASSWORD are your WLAN's credentials.

(*) Boot the first time:

Insert the prepared SD card into your Pi and boot it up.

You'll see a message pop up telling that file system gets automatically extended to cover the full SD card's size; then the system boots again. This time the Pixel desktop comes up.

(*) Open a Terminal

The default hostname is "raspberrypi", the user is "pi" and the password is "raspberry".

* Start up a GUI terminal if you use the Pixel desktop;
* Login if you use a console; or
* Connect from a remote host with ssh (if sshd was already set up). 

E.g.
$ ssh pi@raspberrypi
[raspberry]

(*) In case you need to set up SSH (if not already done):

$ sudo service ssh start

(*) Change Default Password:

$ passwd
[raspberry]
[new_password]
[new_password]

(*) Change Hostname:

Here, the  hostname and the name of the SD card's (2nd) partition is changed. In this example the name "demopi" is used. A dedicated name may be useful if there are other Raspberry Pis on the network and/or if you use more than one SD card.

$ export HOST=demopi
$ echo $HOST | sudo tee /etc/hostname
$ sudo sed -i s/raspberrypi/$HOST/ /etc/hosts
$ sudo e2label /dev/mmcblk0p2 $HOST
$ sudo reboot
$ ssh pi@demopi
[new_password]

(*) Disable / Enable Swap:

Paging on the Pi can be painfully slow; you may be better off without any page space.

Disable default:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop

Enable default:
$ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start

Permanent setting, e.g.:
/etc/dphys-swapfile:CONF_SWAPSIZE=0

See also swapon, swapoff, mkswap.

(*) Set Locale

The following command lets you de/selected your locales.

$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure locales

Note: "If you have users who access the system through ssh, it is recommended that you choose None as your default locale."

(see https://wiki.debian.org/Locale)

(*) Set up the Keyboard Layout:

$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure keyboard-configuration

...this may not work with a remote terminal (it may be necessary to run this on a local terminal with a keyboard attached).

$ sudo service keyboard-setup restart

(see https://wiki.debian.org/Keyboard)

(*) Set Timezone:

$ sudo dpkg-reconfigure tzdata

(see https://wiki.debian.org/TimeZoneChanges)

(*) SSH w/o Password:

Often a host system is used and the Raspberry Pi is headless and/or the Pi is mostly used remotely anyway. In those cases, the password dialog may get a bit annoying. The commands below are executed on the host system.

host$ ssh-keygen -t rsa
host$ cat ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub | ssh pi@demopi 'mkdir -p .ssh && cat >> .ssh/authorized_keys'

This permits the host to log into the Pi without a password. But not the Pi into the host system. You may not want to enable the latter one, especially not if the Pi is exposed.

(*) HDMI Overscan

Enter (or uncomment if already there) the line below in /boot/config.txt if the display has a visible black border of unused pixels and if the display can be used without overscan.

disable_overscan=1
